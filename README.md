# ts-toolkit

This repository contains a set of **advanced and reusable TypeScript utility types** that I use across my projects.

It focuses on type-level helpers that improve expressiveness, safety, and clarity when working with complex TypeScript codebases.

## Philosophy

- Type-level utilities, not runtime code
- Practical over theoretical
- Reuse patterns that prove useful in real projects
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

## How I use it

I use `ts-toolkit` as a shared collection of utility types for modeling complex constraints, composing types, and reducing duplication in TypeScript-heavy projects.

Types are added only when they solve real problems and remain small, explicit, and easy to reason about.

This repository reflects my current approach to advanced TypeScript usage and evolves as those practices change.
